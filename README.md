# Visualization of Website Redesign Survey Results

The results of this website redesign survey are intended to determine whether the HSS website continues to fulfill its goal and to gauge what could be done better to serve the organization's members and the history of science community more widely

## Gridsome, Formstack, and Apexcharts

This data visualization uses Gridsome (with Bulma/Buefy) to build the UI and create a GraphQL layer for accessing the graph data, which is fetched from the Formstack API at build time. 

For development, run `npm run development`
